        <h3> Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 Teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1 Teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 Teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 Ripe bananas, mashed</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon milk</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon ground cinnamon, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 Cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 Cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>2 Large eggs</li>
            <li>1 Cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
        <h3> Steps</h3> 
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan, preferably glass.</li>
            <li>Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. Stir bananas, milk, and cinnamon in another bowl.
                <br> Beat sugar and butter together in a third bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy; add eggs one at a time,
                <br> beating well after each addition. Stir banana mixture into butter mixture; mix in flour mixture until just blended.
                <br> Fold in chocolate chips; pour batter into the prepared loaf pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 70 minutes. 
                <br> Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack before slicing.</li>
        </ol>
